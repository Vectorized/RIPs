## Abstract

This proposal describes a contract that allows the caller to burn a specific amount of gas, and returns a portion of the gas burned to the caller as Ether.

## Motivation

Contract Secured Revenue (CSR) enables contract developers to earn gas fees on their contracts.

It enables new revenue streams in a composable, interoperable, enforceable way. CSR works with any existing token standard and applications. It does not require developers to break or create new contract standards for the sake of capturing value.

However, implicit CSR which is metered by gas spent on every opcode can lead to negative externalities. Developers are incentivized to write bloated contracts, such as using a loop to perform unnecessary storage writes and compute.

This standard proposes making CSR explicit with a special contract that converts burned gas into Ether with a constant cost. Developers are incentivized to write efficient contracts, so that they can have more gas room to use for explicit CSR.

It also offers the following advantages:
- Composability, since Ether can be paid back immediately and predictably to the caller.
- Permissionlessness, since contracts do not need to be vetted by a centralized team to ensure that they are not intentionally writing bloated code.
- Transparency, since the CSR contract can be vetted. This gives developers better clarity and confidence over traditional implicit CSR operated by opaque CRON jobs.
- Maintainability, since the CSR contract can be implemented in Solidity.
- Usability, since explicit CSR gas can be easily segmented from regular gas. The CSR gas can be reflected in wallet interfaces.

## Specification

We will refer to this contract as the `GASBACK` contract.

### Behavior 

The `GASBACK` contract takes in calldata `bytes32(uint256(gasToBurn))`.

The actual amount of gas burned may vary but SHOULD be proportional to `gasToBurn`.

The `GASBACK` contract MUST be `O(1)` in state and compute costs with respect to `gasToBurn`.

The `GASBACK` contract SHOULD give the caller a fraction of the gas burned back as Ether (or native currency).

The `GASBACK` contract SHOULD do a best-effort transfer of Ether to the caller. If transferring Ether with a `call` fails, the `GASBACK` contract MAY create a new contract that use the `SELFDESTRUCT` opcode to force-transfer the Ether.

The `GASBACK` contract MUST return `bytes32(uint256(amountOfEtherGivenBackToCaller))`.

The amount of Ether obtained from the burned gas MUST not exceed `basefee * actualGasBurned`.

### Address

To support a variety of L2 implementations, there is no designated address for the `GASBACK` contract.

To facilitate discovery, we will designate a canonical beacon contract deployed by Nick's `CREATE2` factory. This beacon contract returns `abi.encode(gasbackAddress)` when called.

Final address of the beacon contract TBD.

## Security Considerations

Implementers must make sure that the precompile does not cause a net increase in the total amount of Ether on the network.

EVM chains hosting any retroactive funding based on gas burned metrics should subtract the total amount of gas burned via the `GASBACK` precompile.
